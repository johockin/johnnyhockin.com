# Hybrid Data Loading System

## Overview

This website uses a bulletproof **three-tier data loading system** that ensures users get the full experience regardless of how they access the site:

1. **Primary**: External `data.json` (HTTP/HTTPS - optimal performance)
2. **Secondary**: Embedded JavaScript data (file:// URLs - complete fallback)
3. **Tertiary**: Minimal placeholders (emergency safety net)

## How It Works

### Architecture
- **SiteManager.loadContent()** tries external `data.json` first
- If that fails, uses `window.EMBEDDED_SITE_DATA` from `data-embedded.js`
- Falls back to minimal placeholder content as last resort
- Smart console logging shows which data source is being used

### Files
- `data.json` - Primary data source (single source of truth)
- `data-embedded.js` - Complete embedded fallback data
- `sync-embedded-data.js` - Node.js sync script
- `script.js` - Enhanced SiteManager with hybrid loading

## Usage

### For Development
1. Edit `data.json` as your single source of truth
2. Run sync script when ready to deploy:
   ```bash
   node sync-embedded-data.js
   ```
3. Both HTTP and file:// URLs now work seamlessly

### For Users
- **Production (HTTP)**: Gets fresh data from external JSON
- **Local/Offline**: Gets complete experience from embedded data
- **Network Issues**: Graceful degradation with full content

## Benefits

### Bulletproof Reliability
- Works on file://, http://, https://, CDNs
- Zero breaking changes to existing code
- Complete fallback experience (not just placeholders)
- Self-healing and environment-agnostic

### Performance Optimized
- External data preferred for caching and speed
- Embedded data loads instantly as backup
- No build tools or complexity added

### Maintenance Friendly
- Single source of truth (data.json)
- One command synchronization
- Clear console logging for debugging
- Comprehensive data validation

## Console Output Examples

```
âœ… External data loaded successfully
ðŸ”€ Current path: / | Data source: external
```

```
ðŸ“¦ Using embedded fallback data
ðŸ”€ Current path: / | Data source: embedded
```

## Architecture Philosophy

This system maintains the "fast and simple" vanilla JavaScript philosophy while solving real-world deployment challenges. It's a proven pattern that scales from local development to enterprise deployments without adding unnecessary complexity.
