# PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

**⚠️ READ PROJECT_SPEC.md - IT CONTAINS EVERYTHING**

This file intentionally kept minimal. All project requirements, architecture decisions, design principles, technical guidelines, and development history are documented in PROJECT_SPEC.md.

Do not make assumptions. Read the full spec first.
