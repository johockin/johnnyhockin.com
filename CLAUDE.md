# ✍️ ETHOS AND EXPECTATIONS

### ✅ Project Expectations:
- **Document everything** - Every architectural decision, design tradeoff, mistake made and fixed
- **Specs over assumptions** - When in doubt, ask for clarification
- **No magic** - Code must be explainable to any collaborator
- **Work in stable milestones** - Each chunk of progress must be committable and testable
- **User does the QA** - AI guides testing, user runs tests locally/in browser - AI should never guess at QA results by reading code
- **This file is allowed to be sprawling** - It's the beating heart of the project
- **Flag spec inconsistencies** - AI must identify and flag any issues or inconsistencies found in this spec
