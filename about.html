                <p>Part inventor, part filmmaker, part coder. I build things that shouldn't exist and document the process along the way.</p>
                
                <p>My work sits at the intersection of technology and creativity—building custom hardware, writing software that does unexpected things, and occasionally pointing cameras at the people who make interesting stuff.</p>
                
                <p>This site is a collection of experiments, failed prototypes, successful builds, and the messy process of making. No corporate polish here—just raw documentation of what happens when curiosity meets code.</p>
                
                <p>I believe the best tools are often the ones you build yourself. Whether it's a mechanical keyboard designed for exactly how I type, a MIDI controller made from arcade buttons, or a neural network that can read my terrible handwriting—if it doesn't exist, I'll make it.</p>
                
                <p>The projects here span embedded systems, computer vision, machine learning, audio processing, and whatever else catches my attention. I'm particularly drawn to projects that combine the digital and physical worlds—code that controls hardware, hardware that generates data, and the feedback loops between them.</p>
                
                <p>When I'm not building things, I'm usually documenting the process. Film has always been part of my practice—there's something about watching someone else's creative process that reveals insights you can't get from reading about it. The struggle, the dead ends, the breakthroughs—that's where the real learning happens.</p>
                
                <p>Currently exploring: real-time computer vision for musical performance, mesh networks for environmental sensing, and the surprising creative potential of constraint-based design.</p>
                
                <p>Previous lives include working as a software engineer, documentary filmmaker, and briefly as a sound designer for indie games. Each discipline informed the others in unexpected ways.</p>
                
                <p>Based in Toronto, Ontario. Originally from a small town where fixing things yourself wasn't a hobby—it was necessity.</p>
