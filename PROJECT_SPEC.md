## üèóÔ∏è TECH ARCHITECTURE

- **Framework / language**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript - Chosen for maximum simplicity, performance, and maintainability without build complexity
- **Styling approach**: CSS Custom Properties with 180px grid system - Provides true modular layout with mathematical spacing relationships
- **State management**: Local storage for font preference and chaos mode - Simple persistence without external dependencies  
- **Directory structure plan**: Flat structure with logical file separation (styles.css, script.js, data.json)
- **Key dependencies**: None (Google Fonts for typography only)
- **Planned dev workflow**: Direct file editing, browser testing, git commits
- **Testing tools / approach**: Manual browser testing across devices, no automated testing for this simple static site

## üìí CHANGELOG (REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL)

### 2024-01-30 - Navigation & Link Styling Refinement
- **Changed**: Navigation from centered to left-aligned (NEVER center principle established)
- **Changed**: Custom underlines moved from 2px to -1px below text for natural positioning
- **Added**: Site-wide custom link styling with consistent underlines

- **Decision**: All links should have subtle custom underlines except in CMS content

### 2024-01-30 - Grid System Evolution
- **Changed**: Grid system from 100px to 180px for better proportions
- **Refined**: Spacing uses mathematical relationships (1x, 2x, 4x grid units)
- **Decision**: True grid system means elements snap to grid increments, no arbitrary spacing
- **Reference**: Tom Sachs website grid principles studied and incorporated

### 2024-01-30 - View Controls Repositioning

- **Added**: Vertical text orientation for view controls

- **Decision**: Explorer Log belongs on homepage only, not as separate archive

### 2024-01-30 - Design Philosophy Establishment
- **Established**: No boxes/borders around content sections
- **Established**: Left-aligned text only, never centered
- **Established**: Modular grid-based layout over arbitrary positioning
- **Rejected**: "Cliche and obvious" design patterns

## üéØ DESIGN PRINCIPLES & DECISIONS

### Core Aesthetic Philosophy
- **Raw, smart, precise, experimental** - Tom Sachs meets inventor
- **Modular and systematic** - Everything follows the 180px grid
- **Left-aligned only** - NEVER center content (user emphasis)
- **Minimal but functional** - Maximum functionality with minimal complexity

### Typography System
- **Primary**: Courier Prime (monospace, coding aesthetic)
- **Secondary**: Helvetica Neue (clean, minimal)
- **Toggle functionality**: Button shows in opposite font for clarity
- **Scale**: 13px-16px range for readability without overwhelming

### Grid System Logic
- **Base unit**: 180px (evolved from 100px for better proportions)
- **Spacing multipliers**: 1x (180px), 2x (360px), 4x (720px)
- **Half/quarter units**: 90px, 45px for padding and smaller spacing
- **Philosophy**: Elements snap to grid increments, no arbitrary positioning

### Color Strategy
- **Normal mode**: Black text on white (#000000 on #ffffff)
- **Accent color**: #666666 for subtle emphasis
- **Chaos mode**: Neon colors (#00ffff, #ff00ff, #ffff00) with dark background
- **CMS links**: Standard browser blue (#0066cc) for usability

### Interaction Design
- **Custom cursor**: 32x32px with 8,8 hotspot positioning
- **Link underlines**: Custom positioned -1px below text baseline
- **Hover states**: Color shift to accent color with underline emphasis
- **View controls**: Vertical orientation on left edge for space efficiency
