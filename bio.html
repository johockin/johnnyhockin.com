                JOHNNY HOCKIN is an inventor-filmmaker-coder, probably best known for experimental documentation of technical processes and building systems that combine hardware and software of one kind or another. In a practice that began with repairing electronics and tinkering with code, he has recreated various technical paradigms using only available tools and materials, often foam core and duct tape; later, he made Knoll office furniture out of aluminum extrusions and custom PCBs. Other projects have included his versions of various embedded systems masterpieces, like real-time computer vision modules, and the infamous MIDI Excursion Module, and even the bridge of the USS Enterprise. No engineering project is more complex and pervasive than the domestic ecosystem; he's done versions of those, too, including a home automation system he's built using open-source hardware, custom sensors, and assorted kitchen appliances. He's also done Hello Kitty and her friends in materials ranging from foam core to machined aluminum.
                
                A lot has been made of the conceptual underpinnings of these builds: how Hockin's approach to making things work, remixing, dubbing and spitting it back out again, so that the results are simultaneously transformed and transforming. Equally, if not more important, is his total embrace of "showing his work." All the steps that led up to the end result are always on display. On a practical level, this means that all seams, joints, screws or for that matter anything holding stuff together, like solder joints and breadboard connections, are left exposed. Nothing is erased, sanded away, or rendered invisible. On a more philosophical level, it means embracing failure and iteration as core parts of the creative process.
