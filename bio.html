            <div class="bio-description">
                JOHNNY HOCKIN is an inventor-storyteller who builds things that connect people to moments of presence and meaning. Working at the intersection of technology and human experience, he creates apps, experiments, and interventions that reveal the extraordinary in the everyday. His projects often begin with simple questions: What if we could map our moments of stillness? What if productivity culture celebrated doing nothing? What if strangers could leave notes for each other in subway cars?
                
                His recent work includes Still Marker, an iOS app that tracks when and where you pause during daily movement, creating a personal geography of contemplation. To Don't flips productivity culture by celebrating declined meetings and intentional rest. Subway Blind Dates transforms public transit into spaces for anonymous connection through handwritten notes between strangers. Maggy, his AI writing assistant, is trained exclusively on his own writing patterns to create something that feels like collaboration rather than autocomplete.
                
                All projects share a commitment to privacy-first design, local data storage, and technology that serves human flourishing rather than demanding attention. His approach embraces showing the work—all iterations, failures, and discoveries remain visible as essential parts of the creative process. Whether building custom electronics, developing mobile apps, or documenting urban experiments, he maintains that the most innovative technologies are often the simplest ones that help us pay attention to what matters.
