For a 10-minute short, you get 40.\nFull resolution, proper color space, no bullshit.\n\nFeatures:\n- Progressive frame loading (no crashes on long videos)\n- Frame refinement (Â±0.5s coarse, Â±1 frame fine)\n- Export all or individual frames\n- Kodak Gold aesthetic because why not\n- Chris Marker-inspired dark interface\n\nLooking for filmmakers to test.\nIt works.

I wanted to join in the chorus of apps that don't help you get things done.\n\nTo Don't is my first Mac app.\nI made it as a design experiment. What are the fewest features that make a to-do list feel right?\nWhy am I so bad at estimating how much time it takes to do anything? Can I create a productivity app that helps me get better at that?\n\nRight now it:\n- Adds tasks, gives them time estimates\n- Starts timer, tracks how long it actually took\n- Star system for triaging tasks\n- Local-only, plaintext files\n- No accounts, no sync, no push notifications\n\nEventually it might:\n- Scoreboard: how accurate are you at guessing your own time?\n- Chart time estimation scores over time\n- Stop being so buggy\n- Allow for multiple to-do lists or sync\n\nIt might never be finished.\nI'm still messing with the textures.\n\nPlanning to release v1 to let people play with it soon.",
